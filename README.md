*Forest Cover Type Prediction: Achieved ~90% accuracy using Decision Trees,
#Random Forest; applied feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
1. Project: Forest Cover Type Prediction Using Machine Learning
Objective
Develop a machine learning model to classify forest cover type based on geological and ecological features, then deploy it as a web application for easy user access.

Dataset
You can use the Forest Cover Type dataset from sources like Kaggle or the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes attributes like soil type, elevation, slope, and other environmental features.

Project Workflow
1️⃣   Data Preprocessing
•	Load the dataset using Pandas.
•	Handle missing values and perform data cleaning.
•	Encode categorical variables if necessary.
•	Feature scaling (e.g., StandardScaler from Scikit-learn).
•	Visualize feature distributions using Matplotlib & Seaborn.

2️⃣   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Visualize feature distributions using Matplotlib & Seaborn.
•	Identify correlations with a heatmap.
•	Understand class distribution for model balancing.

3️⃣   Model Building
•	Try Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks (TensorFlow/Keras).
•	Split data into training and test sets.
•	Evaluate models using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision-recall, and F1-score.
4️⃣   Hyperparameter Tuning
•	Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model performance.
5️⃣   Model Deployment with Flask
•	Save the trained model using joblib or pickle.
•	Build a Flask web application where users can input environmental parameters and get predictions.
•	Create an intuitive UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
6️⃣   Deployment on GitHub
•	Deploy on Git Hub
Next Steps
•	Implement feature engineering to improve accuracy.
•	Try deep learning models for better predictions.
•	Add interactive visualizations for results.
